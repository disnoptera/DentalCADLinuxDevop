------------     this is my first txt file made on git -----------


there are a couple methods that we can implement to use Open-Source CAD software for Linux

I used ubuntu as it is a commercial standard to run these, I tried to source FreeCads entire repo but it took to long to build and was loose so i installed it on snap instead, but here you go:


1. MeshLab

2. FreeCAD

3. Open3D
